			<p class = "intropic" id = "aboutme">Hi!  I'm Lily and I'm a junior at Lowell High School.  I enjoy computer science, dance, and music.  I'm currently enrolled in Girls Who Code, and it's been a lot of fun learning and experimenting with different coding languages.  I do Chinese folk dance, but I'm also part of my school's dance program, which teaches a mix of ballet, jazz, conpemporary, and hiphop.  As for music, I learned how to play the violin in 4th and 5th grade, then switched to the viola, which is the instrument I'm playing now.  I also started learning piano less than 2 years ago. </p>
